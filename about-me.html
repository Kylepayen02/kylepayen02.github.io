            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Kyle Payen and I am a junior studying computer science at NYU's Tandon School
                of Engineering. My interest in Software Engineering began when I was 17 years old after attending 
                a technology and entrepenurship summer program at Cooper Union. That experience motivated me to 
                study computer science in college, where I also found an interest in Mathematics and Feminists Studies.
                Moving forward, I want to use everything I've learned to create digital landscapes that are rooted in ethical,
                assessible, and inclusive design practices. 
            </p>
